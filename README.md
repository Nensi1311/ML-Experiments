# Welcome to the ML Algorithms Repository!

Machine Learning (ML): is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. In ML, computers use algorithms to find patterns in data and make predictions or decisions. 

There are three main types of ML:
- Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled data (input-output pairs) to make predictions.
- Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data.
- Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback based on actions.

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms applied to different datasets. It serves as a practical exploration of how different algorithms perform across diverse types of data.
