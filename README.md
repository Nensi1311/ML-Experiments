# Welcome to the ML Algorithms Repository!

Machine Learning (ML): is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. In ML, computers use algorithms to find patterns in data and make predictions or decisions. 

There are three main types of ML:
- Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled data (input-output pairs) to make predictions.
- Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data.
- Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback based on actions.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms applied to different datasets. It serves as a practical exploration of how different algorithms perform across diverse types of data.
This repository includes:

- Code files for machine learning algorithms, implemented in Python.
- Applications of algorithms on different datasets (included in the repository).
- Detailed analysis of results and performance metrics for each algorithm and dataset.
- Techniques used to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Algorithms Covered
Here are some of the key machine learning algorithms implemented in this repository:

1. Supervised Learning:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Random Forest

2. Unsupervised Learning:

- k-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Datasets Used
Each dataset is preprocessed and used to train, validate, and test different models. The datasets are either publicly available or included directly in this repository (or via links if large).
